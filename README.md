# ANN-From-Scratch-for-Digit-Recognition
In this project i have implemented ANN from scratch using only numpy and math
During the research that i have made to implement the network, i have learnd a lot about key concepts in ML and DL such as - overfitting and underfitting, activision functions, linear and non linear model and cross validation.
