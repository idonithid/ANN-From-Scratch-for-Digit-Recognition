# ANN-From-Scratch-for-Digit-Recognition
In this project I have implemented ANN from scratch using only numpy and math.
During the research that I have made to implement this network, I have learnd a lot about key concepts in ML and DL such as - overfitting and underfitting, activision functions, linear and non linear model and cross validation.

Hope you will like it
